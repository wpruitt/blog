				<h3>Day 1</h3>
					<p>Today is the beginning of it all. I venture out on me own into the world to find my place. It's a bit daunting, but I know I will be fine and that I've done what I can to prepare myself mentally. I've never been on my own, but I'm not afraid, in fact, I'm excited for the possible adventures to come</p>

            	<h3>Day 2</h3>
   					<p>So far so good. I've managed to put more miles behind me than I had planned, I should be approaching the first town shortly after breaking camp in the morning. I don't know what this feeling is, the new sensations running through my body have put me in a state of being I've never exeperienced. I can't place the 'empty' feeling in my stomach; maybe its just nerves? </p>

  				<h3>Day 3</h3>
   					<p>That town and its inhabitants gave me a bad feeling. They seemed friendly enough, but overly interested in my journey. I got more questions about where I was going and what my plans were than I felt was neccessary. I expected questions about where I had come from, the life I had lived until now, and what it was I was escaping from. That was the usual line of questioning for the occasional travelers that passed through our village and what I assumed was the same for all the other villages I had heard about. </p>

  				<h3>Day 4</h3>
   					<p>When I woke up I found my things had been searched, though nothing was missing. It makes me uneasy to think I could have slept though someone rummaging though my possesions. No of my traps were tripped and usually the slightest rustling of leaves wakes me. I also fel like I'm being followed, nothing has given me any real indication of that being the case, but that hadn't stopped me from doubling back randomly on my route. Those detours may have thrown off my original plans too much, I was expecting to have reached the next town by now, but I'm not getting any indication that I've even left the center of this forest. I don't think I'll sleep much tonight.</p>

  				<h3>Day 5</h3>
   					<p>It was a frantic dash from whatever creeped into my camp last night, I'm hoping I can hold out until the sun rises... maybe a couple more hours. It came quickly and quietly, if I hadn't been up waiting I don't know what would have happened. Whatever it was seemed to blend into the darkness and only stood out because it seemed to blot out was little light my fire gave off. It's completely silent but I can feel it approaching. As this feeling grows deeper my hope to see the sun fades.</p>

          <h4>Week 1</h4>
          <p>Week 1 ends at NSS. I'm going to be be figuring out the pacing of the class for the next few weeks and adjust to the teaching philosphy. I am quickly becoming comfortable behind the keyboard again and look forward to the flow that comes from being knowledgeable and comfortable with the languages being used. The exercises are what I hoped for, seemingly basic to start, but build up in their complexity. The capstone presentation was done very well. Seeing a class that is halfway though the course and is using the basic skills we have started to see and well see more of in the early weeks gives a sense of scope without being daunting. I'm looking forward to the next couple of weeks and acclimating myself to the general flow of the school.</p>
